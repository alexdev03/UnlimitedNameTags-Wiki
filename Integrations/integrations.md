## 🔗 **Integrations**

UnlimitedNameTags integrates seamlessly with various plugins to extend functionality and enhance the player experience. Below are the supported integrations:

---

### **Oraxen** 🎩

**Oraxen** integration is supported starting from version 2.x. This integration adjusts the Y offset of the name tag based on the texture height, allowing for a more dynamic and immersive display of custom hats. When a player wears an Oraxen hat, the position of their name tag will shift to better align with the height of the hat, creating a smoother and more visually pleasing effect.

### **MiniPlaceholders** 🧩

**MiniPlaceholders** integration is supported for using mini placeholders. Note that you need to use **MINIMESSAGE** or **UNIVERSAL** as the name tag formatter to utilize this feature effectively.
