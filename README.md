## **Requirements**

- Minecraft **Paper 1.20.1+** or **Spigot 1.20.2+**
- [PacketEvents](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/packetevents-api.80279/)


## 📜 **Supported Versions**
- **Paper**: Fully supported from **1.20.1+** *(highly recommended)*.
- **Spigot**: Supported from **1.20.2+**, but Paper is preferred for enhanced performance.

> **Note**: Versions below **1.19.4** do not support text displays because the required packet functionality does not exist. Additionally, clients connecting with **ViaBackwards** are not compatible and will not display name tags correctly. For the best experience, ensure both the server and clients are using compatible versions.
> You may connect with 1.19.4 client using **ViaBackwards** and **ViaVersion** and a server on one of the supported versions.
