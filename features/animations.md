# ðŸŽ¨ **Creating Animations with Built-in Placeholders**

In **UnlimitedNameTags**, you can create animations by using built-in placeholders that return integer or double values. These placeholders help animate properties like color transitions, size, and other aspects of name tags in a smooth, dynamic way.

Here are the placeholders designed for animating colors and effects, which can be used with the **MINIMESSAGE** and **MINEDOWN** formats.

## ðŸŒˆ **Available Placeholders for Animations**

### 1. **`#phase-mm#` (MINIMESSAGE)**
- **Description**: This placeholder is used for animating values in **MINIMESSAGE** format, especially for rainbow effects.
- **Range**: The value ranges from `10` (full brightness) to `1` (minimal brightness).
- **Usage**: It is used for animating color transitions, often for rainbow effects.
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  "<rainbow:#phase-mm#>MiniMessage rainbow animation with UnlimitedNameTags %player_name%</rainbow>"
  ```
    - The color of the text animates from vibrant to dull as the value of `#phase-mm#` changes.

### 2. **`#phase-mm-g#` (MINIMESSAGE for Gradient)**
- **Description**: This placeholder is used for creating **gradient** animations in **MINIMESSAGE** format.
- **Range**: The value ranges from `-1.0` (full gradient transition) to `1.0` (no transition), with increments of `0.1`.
- **Usage**: It is used for creating smooth color gradients based on the specified `phase` value.
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  "<gradient:#5e4fa2:#f79459:red:#phase-mm-g#>MiniMessage gradient animation
        with UnlimitedNameTags %player_name%</gradient> "
  ```
    - In this example, the text is displayed with a gradient that transitions from green to blue. The `#phase-mm-g#` value controls the intensity of the gradient transition.

### 3. **`#phase-md#` (MINEDOWN)**
- **Description**: This placeholder is used for animating values in **MINEDOWN** format.
- **Range**: The value ranges from `16777215` (white) to `0` (black).
- **Usage**: Use this placeholder when you want to animate between colors in **MINEDOWN** format.
- **Example**:
  ```yaml
  "&rainbow:#phase-md#&Minedown animation with UnlimitedNameTags %player_name%"
  ```
  - As the value of `#phase-md#` changes, the color in the name tag animates.

## Changing the Animation Speed

You can change the speed of the animation by modifying the `taskInterval` setting in the `settings.yml` file. The default value is `20`, which means the animation will run every 20 ticks.
If you want to reduce the animation speed, you can set a lower value, minimum is `1`.

in the `settings.yml` file:
```yaml
taskInterval: 5
```
