## 🔗 **Integrations**

UnlimitedNameTags integrates seamlessly with various plugins to extend functionality and enhance the player experience. Below are the supported integrations:

---

### **Nexo** 🎩

**Nexo** integration is supported.
This integration adjusts the Y offset of the name tag based on the texture height, allowing for a more dynamic and immersive display of custom hats. When a player wears an Nexo (or from a resource pack that Nexo merges) hat, the position of their name tag will shift to better align with the height of the hat, creating a smoother and more visually pleasing effect.

### **ItemsAdder** 📦

**ItemsAdder** integration is supported (**BETA**)
This integration allows for the use of custom items and blocks in the name tag display. When a player wears an ItemsAdder hat, the name tag will adjust its position to align with the height of the item, providing a more immersive experience.
This feature is currently in beta and may not work perfectly with all items. If you encounter any issues, please report them.

### **Hats Plugins** 🎩

Plugins that provide custom hats like HMCCosmetics and CosmeticsCore should be compatible if they are used alongside **Nexo** or **ItemsAdder**.
This feature is currently in **BETA** and may not work perfectly with all items. If you encounter any issues, please report them.
